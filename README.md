# ENMUmobile

<p align="justify">
    In our CS 458, Android Development course, we embraced the challenge of addressing a pressing issue faced by students at Eastern New Mexico University. Despite a vibrant student body of over 4,000, the university lacked a dedicated campus-specific application to cater to student needs. Drawing from our own experiences as students, we had a clear vision of the ideal functionalities and features

    of such an application. To bring this vision to life, we utilized Flutter, a cutting-edge UI software development kit, ensuring seamless cross-compatibility across both Android and IOS platforms. This project not only enhanced our technical skills but also will contribute significantly to the student community at ENMU.
