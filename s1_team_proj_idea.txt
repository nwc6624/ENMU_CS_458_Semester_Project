Our project centers around developing a custom university resources application specifically designed for ENMU students. 
This application's primary goal is to offer students easy access to crucial information, including things such as campus maps,
safety ride contacts, advisor contact details, and more. Following our presentation on September 19th, our next plans involve 
creating a user-friendly interface for the application where students can input ENMU-related queries. The application
will then employ web scraping techniques to extract the most precise and relevant information from the university's website,
ensuring users receive accurate and pertinent responses. We are currently in the process of finalizing the technical aspects
and logistics of the project, and we are scheduling a meeting with Dr. Edgar Eduardo Ceh-Varela to seek guidance on the
technologies and machine learning concepts we will be implementing.
